ðŸŒ¸ Reflection
Honestly, this assignment felt quite easy for me because I already had some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS. But I have to say, it was really nice to review everything again. Going over the structure, the tags, and styling with CSS reminded me how fun it is to build a page from scratch. It was amazing to refresh my memory and create all the necessary parts.

I didnâ€™t face any challenges or difficulties this time since it was about the basics. Still, I really enjoyed the whole process. The resources you shared were super helpful, and I even learned a few new things that I hadnâ€™t paid much attention to before. Also, the video by Kevin Powell was amazing! Heâ€™s actually one of my favorite instructors online, and I always enjoy the way he explains things â€” very clear and interesting.

Overall, it was a smooth and enjoyable experience and Iâ€™m happy I got to build this simple webpage while reviewing everything again.
